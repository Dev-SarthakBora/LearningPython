# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Python Learning Repository**!  
This repo documents my journey of learning Python step by step — from **basics to advanced concepts** with neatly organized programs.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered
- ✅ Basics (variables, datatypes, operators)  
- ✅ Control Flow (if-else, loops, patterns)  
- ✅ Functions (recursion, lambda, higher-order)  
- ✅ Exception Handling (try-except, custom errors)  
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs concepts)  
- ✅ Data Structures (lists, sets, dicts, stacks & queues)  
- ✅ Algorithms (searching, sorting, BFS, DFS)  
- ✅ Advanced (file handling, decorators, threading)  
- ✅ Mini Projects (calculator, todo app, games)
